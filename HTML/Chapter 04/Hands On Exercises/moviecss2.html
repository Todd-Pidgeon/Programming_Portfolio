    <title>My Favorite Movie: Terminator 2: Judgement Day</title>

    <h1>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</h1>
    <p>Terminator 2: Judgement Day is, in my opinion, the greatest science fiction action movie of all time. It also
    happens to be one of the greatest sequels of all time. The original Terminator movie was great in it&apos;s own
    right, however I feel through the success of the first film, James Cameron was able to have the budget needed to
    make Terminator 2 the movie he had always envisioned and that it deserved to be. Terminator 2: Judgement Day holds
    up as an outstanding achievement in special effects, still looking great and believable to this day. The film also
    cemented the Terminator as a character in all our minds and will continue as one of the great action icons for
    all time.</p>

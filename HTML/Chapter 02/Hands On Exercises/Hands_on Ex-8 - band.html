    <h4>
        Top 3 Beyond Within albums:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>
            Torn Soul
            </strong>
            <br>
            A yet unreleased album, it is set to be completed within the coming months. One could say this makes it
            ineligible for this list, however, being a forming and integral member of the band I have inside knowledge
            of the album's projected quality. This album will fully showcase the band's progression of talent and
            newer more mature vision. Continuing further down the technical and fast death metal path. This album will
            melt faces and destroy worlds.

            <strong>
                Eternal Pestilence
            </strong>
            <br>
            Released in 2006, this album is a tour of melodic death metal force from start to finish and stands as a
            culmination of the bands tireless efforts of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Belligerence
            </strong>
            <br>
            Released in 2003, this is the band's first effort, and it shows. The production quality and overall
            coherence may be lacking, but the album still manages to have many good metal tracks. This album stand as
            a starting point to the band's tenure within the strong Metal community.
